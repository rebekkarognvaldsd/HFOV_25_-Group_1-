Risk mitigation measures 

(Risk 1) Social security usage: This risk primarily involves security and as a mitigation, good security would be a key factor. Measures like encrypting data, not storing all the SSN at one place, limit access and following guidelines around storing personal data. 

(Risk 2) Search button visibility: This risk concerns UI design and UX. This risk happens often and most users have experienced this. To mitigate it would be wise to test often with users to ensure visibility as well as using standard icons like a magnifying glass. 

(Risk 3) Setting financial goals usability: This risk is all about UX. The risk is mainly that the process might become too complicated for users and not engaging. To mitigate potential difficulties it’s best to always test thoroughly with users. Consider using tooltips or help icons as well as pre filling criteria that the user has already provided. 

(Risk 4) Personalization of tips: This risk is also all about UX. A risk that the user doesn’t like the tips or doesn’t think they are relevant. Mitigation strategies like letting users give feedback and maybe customizing the tips to better suit them would be worth considering. The timing of the tips might also be worth controlling to ensure the relevance of the tip. 

(Risk 5) Color palette confusion: The color palette is a factor that is often overlooked by developers but it is a vital part of the UX. As the app is a banking app it needs to look professional to ensure users' trust. A mitigation strategy would mainly involve a lot of user testing. A good feature could be to provide themes for users to choose from (e.g. dark mode, light mode) in the app. 

(Risk 6) Rewards system usability: A reward system needs to actually be rewarding. To ensure user satisfaction it would be good to explain rewards and why they matter, show progress of rewards and send users notifications when a reward can be claimed. User testing is important here as the risk is based on the users’ experience. 

(Risk 7) Savings goals understandability: To reduce the risk of users ignoring the savings goals feature, it is possible to show a progress bar to make it more visible to the user how much has been saved so far. Make it clear to the user how to use the feature with tips and walkthroughs. It would also be possible to offer goal options based on common use cases to inspire and guide users on what they can save for. These measures can help users understand the benefits of the savings goals and make them more motivated to use them. 

(Risk 8) Press electronic documents: To reduce this risk, it is important to ensure that the document handling follows data protection standards because the documents include personal and financial information. It is also important to make sure the file storage and transmission are secure by storing documents in encrypted formats and using HTTPS to protect them during downloads. These measures will help ensure documents are securely handled. 

(Risk 9) Use Rafræn skilríki to confirm transactions: to reduce this risk, it is important to contact Rafræn skilríki to understand their technical requirements and documentation, as well as relying on provider-approved tools to reduce bugs and integration complexity. It is also important to have some extra time in your development timeline if something unexpected happens when integrating. It is also important to make sure the system keeps user data safe by following privacy rules. These steps help lower the risk of problems that could happen when using an outside service to handle secure logins. 

(Risk 10)  Accessibility settings unclear: To reduce the risk of users with specific needs not finding the accessibility settings, it would be possible to have a shortcut to the accessibility settings on the main home screen. That way, users with specific needs would not need to look for it. Another way to reduce the risk is to do user testing and get feedback. These measures will make sure your app is usable for everyone. 

(Risk 11) Press the “more” menu button: to reduce the risk of users not finding actions in the ‘’more’’ button, it would be possible to make a little tutorial inside the app when users first get the app, that shows what actions can be found in the more button. Users can also use the search bar that is on the home screen to access actions that could be in the ‘’more’’ section. These measures can make sure that some functionality doesn’t go unnoticed, especially by new users.  

(Risk 12) Filter by transaction type/date/category value: to reduce the risk of users not using this functionality, it would be best to test the filters with real users to see if they are easily understandable. It would be possible to provide tips and guided walkthroughs to help users understand what the filters do and how they can be useful to them. In conclusion, make the filters easy to understand and check how the user reacts to them before investing in full functionality.
